# Logi Z407 Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering of the protocol used between the Logitech Z407 Bluetooth Computer Speakers and the accompanying dial
remote.

Logitech doesn't sell replacement remotes, so losing or breaking your remote makes your speakers pretty much useless.
This reverse engineering effort aims to keep Z407 speakers out of landfills by enabling owners to use other devices as 
remote replacements or build their own replacements using off-the-shelf components.

There is currently only a simple prototype and no usable product in place.

Feel free to have a look at the [proof of concept implementation](./main.py) or
[protocol documentation](doc/Protocol.md).
